# Autohotkey HTTP server for tasker

Most of the code is from other sources, I just modified to my need.

With this Autohotkey script I control my PC with Tasker.

In Tasker I just do an HTTP GET Request to my machine's IP port 8080
http://192.168.0.100:8080/notify

Works better with PC static IP

Only works on LAN
